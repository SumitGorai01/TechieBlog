We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering a community that is open, welcoming, inclusive, and healthy. We will act and interact in ways that contribute positively to this environment.
